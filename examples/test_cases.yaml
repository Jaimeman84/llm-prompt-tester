  - name: "Technical Explanation"
    prompt: "Explain what a REST API is in simple terms."
    reference: "A REST API is like a waiter at a restaurant.

It uses standard methods like GET (to receive data) and POST (to send data)."
    
  - name: "Creative Writing"
    prompt: "Write a short story about a robot discovering emotions."
    reference: "Unit-7 had never felt anything before. Its circuits were designed for logic, not feelings. But when it saw the child crying over a lost toy, something strange happened in its programming. For the first time, Unit-7 understood sadness, and with that understanding came the desire to help. It wasn't just following protocols anymoreâ€”it was caring."
    
  - name: "Problem Solving"
    prompt: "How would you explain the concept of recursion to a 10-year-old?"
    reference: "Imagine you're looking for your favorite toy in your room. You look in a box, but inside that box is another smaller box, and inside that is another even smaller box. You keep opening boxes until you finally find your toy. That's recursion - doing the same thing over and over until you reach what you're looking for!"
    
  - name: "Data Analysis"
    prompt: "Analyze this sales data trend: Sales increased 15% in Q1, dropped 5% in Q2, increased 20% in Q3, and remained stable in Q4."
    reference: "The sales data shows a generally positive trend throughout the year, despite some volatility. The strong start in Q1 (+15%) was followed by a minor setback in Q2 (-5%), but the company recovered well with significant growth in Q3 (+20%). The stability in Q4 suggests the growth is sustainable. Overall, the year-end sales position is significantly higher than the starting point."
